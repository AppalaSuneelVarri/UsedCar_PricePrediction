# UsedCar_PricePrediction_DataAnalysis

Problem statement:


When customers consider selling their vehicles and seek an estimate of their resale value, they typically turn to either the company workshop or third-party applications. Leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict the value or price of used cars can greatly benefit customers, enabling them to negotiate a fair price based on the current market value.

Several factors significantly influence the resale price of used cars, including the brand, mileage, fuel type, and year of purchase. To analyze and determine the most suitable algorithm for predicting resale values from sales data, multiple machine learning algorithms were employed. These algorithms include Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Analysis, and XGBoost.

By applying these algorithms to the sales data, a thorough analysis was conducted to identify the algorithm that best fits the data and provides accurate predictions of the resale values for used cars.
